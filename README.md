# Frog Counting

Frog Counting will consist of two websites: Frog Whisperer, and Frog Counter.

Frog Whisperer (built on Zupass) will ultimately issue the user `FrogWhisperer` PODs that they can cash in at the merch store at DevCon (!).

The user first navigates to Frog Counter (also built on Zupass). Frog Counter will allow the user to i) fetch their Frogs from Zupass and ii) generate a proof that says “I have N frogs” (where N can be very large, thanks to Sonobe/folding schemes). The website then:

- Gets an array of `Frogs` from Zupass (using the new ZApp API!)
- Generate Circuit Inputs
  - Create `Frogs` (automatically passed into circuit), which have entries:
    - `ownerSemaphoreID` (user’s Semaphore ID)
    - `frogSignerPubkey` of frog POD issuer
    - `frogSignature` from frog POD issuer, signs (merkle root of) frog POD contents
    - `semaphoreIdentityTrapdoor`, `semaphoreIdentityNullifier` fetched from user's identity PCD
    - ...
  - Hardcodes (not useful) `watermark=2718`, `reservedField{i}=0`, `externalNullifier=STATIC_ZK_EDDSA_FROG_PCD_NULLIFIER`
- Generates ZK proof with the circuit inputs above (using the Sonobe library for folding schemes)
- Outputs the Sonobe `proof`, which has entries:
  - `public_inputs` (= public outputs), includes N = number of frogs) [?]
  - `vkey` = `nova_cyclefold_vk`
  - `proof` = `D::prove(rng, decider_pp, nova.clone()).unwrap()`

The user will then navigate back to the original Frog Rewards website and paste in the `proof`, `public_inputs`, and `vkey`. Then the website will:

- Verify the proof in the backend
- Issue a `FrogWhisperer` POD signed with the website’s secret key `verifier_sk`
  - POD contains:
    - PODEntries:
      - `public_signals` = # of frogs that user owns
      - picture of frog whisperer :), description, title (flavortext)
      - owner = `semaphoreID.commitment` (user’s public semaphore ID)
    - signature of POD content (PODEntries) with website’s `verifier_sk`
- Put the POD in the user’s Zupass “FrogWhisperer” folder
